* Run a self-test on the driver/device. This function does a minimal test
* in which the data register is read. It only does a read without any kind
* of test because the hardware has been parameterized such that it may be only
* an input such that the state of the inputs won't be known.
*
* All other hardware features of the device are not guaranteed to be in the

*		XGpio_Initialize().
*
* @return 	XST_SUCCESS always. If the GPIO device was not present in the
*		hardware a bus error could be generated. Other indicators of a
*		bus error, such as registers in bridges or buses, may be
*		necessary to determine if this function caused a bus error.
